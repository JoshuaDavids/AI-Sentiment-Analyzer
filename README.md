# AI-Sentiment-Analyzer

Welcome to the AI-Sentiment-Analyzer repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for sentiment analysis in text data.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to analyze a piece of text to understand the sentiment behind it. This can be useful in various applications, such as customer reviews, social media monitoring, and market research.

Our AI-Sentiment-Analyzer uses a deep learning approach to achieve this. It utilizes a pre-trained language model and fine-tunes it on a labeled dataset to learn the sentiment classification task.

### 1. Introduction

AI-Sentiment-Analyzer is a Python library that uses deep learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of a given text. It is built on top of the popular deep learning library, TensorFlow, and the natural language processing library, NLTK.

### 2. Installation

To install AI-Sentiment-Analyzer, you can use pip:
#### Bash
```

pip install ai-sentiment-analyzer
​
```

### 3. Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use AI-Sentiment-Analyzer:
#### Python
```

from sentiment_analysis import SentimentAnalyzer
​
# Create an instance of the SentimentAnalyzer class
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
​
# Analyze the sentiment of a given text
text = "I love this product! It's amazing."
result = analyzer.analyze_sentiment(text)
​
# Print the result
print(result)
​
```

This will output the sentiment of the text, which can be either "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
